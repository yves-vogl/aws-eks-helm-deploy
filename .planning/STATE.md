## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7-phase structure derived from SUMMARY.md §6 sequencing and ARCHITECTURE.md 10-phase build order, consolidated into 7 to match `granularity: standard`.
- Roadmap: Log-masking (SEC-06) sequenced before PIPE-03 (PR-comment helm-diff) as hard precondition.
- Roadmap: Release pipeline + Cosign + SBOM + Trivy + pip-audit + multi-arch consolidated into a single Phase 6 ("Release & Supply Chain") for plan-size economy.
